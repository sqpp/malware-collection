                <p>The most important part of being staff on Ocean State Roleplay is knowing the rules. So start by following the link here to read the rules.</p>
                <hr />
                <p class="lead" style="font-weight: bold;">Step 2: Making the Application</p>
                <p>As mentioned before, be sure to put some effort into making the application. We do not demand that is it 6 pages long, it can be short and to the point as well. It is very recommended to follow up on the application you made, answer the comments given by both users and staffs on the forums. refrain from adding links or mention other servers, if we wish to know where you worked at then we will ask you.</p>
                <p>If you get rejected then you will have to wait 2 weeks to apply once more. Try improving the mentioned cons of the previous application and be more active. Reposting the same application with no other changes what so ever will result in banning from applications.</p>
                <hr />
                <p class="lead" style="font-weight: bold;">Step 3: Submitting the Application</p>
                <p>Simply click the button below to make the application. Remember to read the questions carefully and plan your answers; do not rush it.</p>
                <p>Please make sure you meet our playtime requirement. You can verify this by clicking <a href="https://oceanstaterp.com/playtime" target="_blank">here.</a></p>

                <p class="lead" style="font-weight: bold;">Step 4: Waiting for Judgement</p>
                <p>Now that you have made an application you’ll need to wait for someone from the recruitment team to tag you in #application-responses channel about whether you’ve been invited to a interview or not. If you haven’t been accepted, you can request to find out why the judgement was made but you can reapply in 2 weeks time! Just start counting down the days.</p>

                <p class="lead" style="font-weight: bold;">Step 5: Interview Phase</p>
                <p>The final step in getting a staff rank is passing the interview on Discord. We take our community’s safety very seriously and we do not allow everyone into our staff team. The interview will contain several questions regarding rules and others.</p>
                <p>The interview may take up to 15 minutes to complete, stay calm. There is nothing to be afraid of; if you have any questions during this time, please feel free to ask them.</p>
