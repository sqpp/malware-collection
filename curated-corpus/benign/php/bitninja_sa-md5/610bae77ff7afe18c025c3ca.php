          <h6>Who is eligible to join CBHS?</h6>
          <div>
            <p>You are eligible if you or one of your parents, partner, siblings, dependants or grandparents are a current or former employee of the Commonwealth Bank Group (CBA Group).</p>

<p>If you are no longer employed by the CBA Group, you and your immediate family are still eligible to join or stay with CBHS.</p>

<p>If you previously worked for the Commonwealth Bank Group but did not join CBHS at the time, you and your immediate family will always remain eligible to join CBHS.</p>
          </div>
          <h6>What does the 'CBA Group' Include?</h6>
          <div>
            <p>
‘CBA Group’ includes:<br>
<strong>- Aussie Homeloans <br>
- Bankwest <br>
- Colonial First State <br>
- Commonwealth Bank, CommSec, & CommInsure <br>
- Count Financial <br>
- Financial Wisdom <br>
- Finance Sector Union <br>
- Gateway Bank 
            </strong></p>
          </div>
          <h6>What do I have to do if I leave the CBA Group?</h6>
          <div>
            <p>When you leave the CBA Group, you are still eligible to remain or re-join as a member of CBHS. Please contact us when you know your last day at CBA so that we can update your billing details.
</p>
          </div>
			<h6>Do I need to re-serve waiting periods when I join CBHS?</h6>
          <div>
            <p>No, as long as you transfer from equivalent cover from another Australian health fund (as confirmed by your Transfer Certificate) and you have served all the waiting period with your previous fund, you will not be required to re-serve waiting periods with CBHS. Waiting periods may apply if you choose to upgrade to a higher level of cover.</p>  
          </div>
			<h6>Who can be covered by my couple or family policy?</h6>
          <div>
            <p>We all know that couples and families come in lots of diverse sizes and shapes. We love diversity and encourage it in our family!</p>

<p>In everything we do, CBHS works to ensure that there is no discrimination regardless of gender, cultural background, ethnicity or sexual orientation.</p>

<p>Up to two parents and their children can be covered by a family policy regardless of whether your family has one dad and one mum, one dad, one mum, two dads or two mums – our family policies can cover parents and their adopted children; and foster parents (including grandparents, aunts and uncles etc.) who have children in their legal care. For children to be included on a family policy, it’s important that guardianship be recognised by a Federal or State government agency such as Medicare or one of the state-based family/community services agencies and we may ask for evidence of this guardianship.</p>

<p>Children are covered by your family policy until they turn 18 (or 25 if they are still studying). If you have children aged 18 or over who aren’t studying, we encourage you to upgrade to our non-student dependant cover which covers them until they turn 25 regardless of their studying status.</p>

<p>For cover for other extended family members check out our eligibility rules. If you have any questions about cover for your partner and/or family, please contact our Member Care team on 1300 654 123 or email <a href="mailto:help@cbhs.com.au">help@cbhs.com.au.</a></p>

        <p>Your privacy is very important to us and we are committed to upholding the highest standards when handling your personal information and protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time and any amended privacy policy will be displayed at momentumlife.co.nz.</p>

<p>During our relationship with you, we may tell you more about the way we handle your personal information (like when you complete an application or claim form). Please also consider this information carefully, as it might differ from the general privacy information set out below.</p>
		  <p><strong>Your consent</strong></p>
        <p>When you provide your personal information to Momentum Life, you are consenting to the use of your information by us for the purposes set out in this Policy and in accordance with our obligations under this Policy, and under the Privacy Act 1993 and Health Information Privacy Code 1994.</p>
        <p><strong>Collecting your personal information</strong></p>
        <p>The information we collect about you and any other person connected to the policy (this includes any nominated beneficiaries, the policy owner and lives insured), directly or indirectly will depend upon the product or service you are applying for or using. This includes your contact details and, as applicable, the names, dates of birth and gender of those you are seeking to insure. For some insurance applications and some claims, it is necessary for us to collect sensitive information from the life to be insured or claimant related to their health, pastimes and occupation.</p>
		  
		     <p>

				 We collect information about you in a few ways:</p>

       
<p>
                <li>During our quote and online purchase process;</li>

                <li>Through claims forms; and/or</li>

                <li>Over the telephone or email when you contact us, or we contact you</li></p>

           

        <p>  We generally record all telephone calls for business and training purposes.</p>

		 <p>Generally, we collect personal and health information directly from you. We may also collect your basic contact information from a third party, such as an adviser or list provider. Sometimes we collect your personal and health information from other third parties, such as your medical practitioner (in the event of a claim). We only collect your information from third parties with your consent or where permitted by law.</p>
        <p>We may also collect information about you when you use our website to get a quote for cover or request information on a product or service.</p>
        <p>If you are unsure where we first obtained your contact information, you may ask us to provide the source of that information.</p>
        <p>Please note that if we are unable to collect the information we need to process an application or assess a claim, then the application or claim may not be accepted.</p>

Your information is stored on secure servers that are protected in controlled facilities in Australia and New Zealand and if we are using cloud-based services, we take all reasonable steps to ensure that your information is protected from loss and unauthorised access, use, modification, or disclosure. We regularly review our technology to ensure we are up-to-date with security threats.</p>

<p>Privacy training is a mandatory requirement for our staff and representatives, and we take data breaches extremely seriously. The procedures we have in place to protect your privacy include checking your identity when you call us, using secure passwords for our computer systems and hosting our website on secure servers.</p>

<p>All third party entities which are required to access your personal information are bound by strict confidentiality agreements.</p>

<p>We will retain your personal information until it is no longer required to provide you with insurance services or meet any other legislative requirements. This means that we may need to retain some of your personal information after you have ceased to be our customer.

<p>You have the right to ask us for a copy of any personal information we hold about you. You can only request information about yourself, unless you have the consent of other parties to request information on their behalf.</p>

<p>You can request your information by calling us on 0800 111 679, emailing us at customercare@momentumlife.co.nz, or writing to us at the address set out below. We must take steps to ensure that you are authorised to request the information. This will require us to verify your identity.</p>

<p>We prefer that you make requests in writing, particularly where you are requesting a copy of your health information. This is because your health information is particularly sensitive and we want to make sure we’re releasing it to the right person. It also helps us to make sure we understand your request fully. However, if you do not wish to make your request in writing, let us know.</p>

<p>The Privacy Act requires us to make a decision on your request, and convey this to you, within 20 working days of receiving it. However, we will respond to your request as soon as we can.</p>

<p>The Privacy Act permits us to withhold personal information in certain circumstances, such as where the information is commercially sensitive or legally privileged. If we decide to withhold information from you, we will tell you and explain why. You can challenge our decision following the steps set out below.</p>

<p>We are permitted to charge a reasonable fee to cover the costs of processing your request, including to compile, print or courier the information. If we intend to charge a fee, we’ll let you know before we process the request.</p>

<em><p>Correction</p></em>

<p>We strive to ensure that your personal information is accurate, up to date and complete. It is important that the information we rely on to administer your policy, particularly your contact information, is correct.</p>

<p>However, you can ask us to correct any information we hold about you that you believe is inaccurate. You can do this by calling us on 0800 111 679 or emailing us at customercare@momentumlife.co.nz</p>

<p>If we cannot correct your information, we’ll tell you why. In that case, you can ask us to attach your request to the information as a “statement of correction”.</p>
        <p><strong>Questions or concerns</strong></p>
