    <p>Sainik School Chandrapur is the 29th Sainik School in India and the second in the state of Maharashtra. The school was conceptualized in the year 2015 and became functional from academic session 2019-20.<br>

    "Gyanay Danaaych, Rakshanaay", the motto itself says for this place. I find myself blessed to get the opportunity to serve as the Second Principal of this school and prepare the school cadets to become military leaders of tomorrow.<br>
        Every parent strives hard to give his ward the best education and this school gives them the perfect platform, where we teach them to respect all cultures, languages and religions. The school is located in lush green valley of Chandrapur and cadets learn to be sensitive & appreciate the needs and beauty of nature and contribute towards clean and healthy environment. The objective of this school i.e. to impart academic training of highest quality, enable cadets to achieve requisite physical and endurance standards, proficiency in team games; endeavour will be to inculcate a desire for self-improvement and drive to excel in every sphere.
        Challenges in future are immense. The challenges for us now are to prepare cadets for the opportunities and challenges of the future. Towards this we should continue to upgrade our knowledge, since what we know today will be redundant tomorrow.
        In the end I would like to say that Teachers have an influencing role in the life of every student. They mould us and, in the process, shape our future. What we learn from our teachers remains with us, throughout our lives. However, very often, we fail to show our appreciation. Teachers do need encouragement and support from the community to feel that their efforts are being recognized. This support has been extended and I am sure it will continue so that we can take the school to greater heights.<br>
        I assure you that, team SSCN will continue this journey on the road to excellence as we stand committed to ensure development of each cadets as better citizens of tomorrow.<br>
