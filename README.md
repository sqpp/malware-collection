# BitNinja malware-mega-corpus

This is the new, enhanced version of the malware-corpus repository.
Our goal is to create a malware corpus which is at leas 10 times bigger than the
riginal corpus, contains benign files, supports injected malware generaton and has the
ablity to auto benchmark the differet anti-malware solutions, incluuding bitninja malware 
detecton. At the same time provide us enugh data to train larger AI models.

From this point it is the old howto: Fixme

## How to use ##

You can use this repo to benchmark malware detection. Even for bitninja or other
systems. The very first step is to check out the repo. Check it out into a whitelisted
area, so the malware detector won't start to quarantine the files. /root is a safe
place usually.

First run the 01_copy_files.php to place the files

```bash
./01_copy_files.php /home/malware-test
```

When it is done, you can start a full scan on the directory with the malware engine
you are benchmarking.

Once it finished the scan, run the 02_compare_files.php

```bash
./02_compare_files.php /home/malware-test
```

This will give you the benchmark numbers.

To make it more easy to find files not quarantined, you can run the ./delete_empty_dirs.sh
If you add more files from bitninja quarantine, you can use the ./delete_info_files.sh helper to
remove the info files.
